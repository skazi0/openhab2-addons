#Pure C Library for decoding of weather station sensor data for Linux#

Many weather stations such as Cresta, Hideki, Honeywell, Irox, Mebus, and TFA Nexus
devices use a common protocol to receive data from wireless 433MHz sensors.

This library is part of hideki openhab binding for receiving and decoding the sensor data.
